# Project Title
Course Rating and Enrollment Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes the relationship between course ratings and student enrollments using a dataset of online courses. The objective is to understand how course ratings influence the number of students enrolled in various courses.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from an online course platform, containing information about course titles, organizations, certificate types, ratings, difficulty levels, and student enrollments.

## Analysis
The analysis performed includes data cleaning, conversion of relevant columns to numeric types, and the generation of a correlation heatmap to visualize the relationship between course ratings and student enrollments.

## Correlation Heatmap
The correlation heatmap illustrates the positive correlation between course ratings and the number of students enrolled. Higher course ratings are associated with a greater number of students enrolled.
